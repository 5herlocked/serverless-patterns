      "This sample project demonstrates how to use a Rekognition Stream Processors to analyse Kinesis Video Streams with a variety of operations and then pass the generated metadata to AWS Lambda for further processing/analytics. This pattern is leveraging the native integration between Kinesis Video and Rekognition Stream Processors which means only CloudFormation and resource ARNs are used to form these connections.",
      "",
      "This pattern deploys the following resources: 1 Kinesis Video Stream, 1 Kinesis Data Stream, 1 Rekogntion Stream Processor, 1 Lambda Function, 1 Kinesis Firehose, 1 S3 Bucket"
